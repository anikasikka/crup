## Course Description
This 12-week course offers an introduction to Software Engineering (SWE), Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). It was designed in response to the emerging industry shift toward AI-integrated systems. Students will gain hands-on experience with programming in Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, explore frameworks like React, Node.js, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and develop machine learning models such as neural networks and decision trees.

## Desired Course Outcomes
By the end of 12 weeks, students should:  
- Be comfortable with programming in Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL  
- Know common data structures: Arrays, LinkedLists, Trees, HashTables  
- Be familiar with frameworks: React, Node.js, NPM, PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn  
- Have a basic understanding of databases  
- Understand fundamental ML/AI concepts like optimization and neural networks  
- Feel comfortable working in a team environment similar to industry
